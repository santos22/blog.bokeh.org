**We are pleased to announce the release of Bokeh 1.0.3!**

Specific issues completed for this release include:

* Enable Copy-and-Paste from ``DataTable`` [`#7762`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/7762)
* Add a Multi-line ``TextAreaInput`` widget [`#2828`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/2828)

Since the last two micro releases did not get their own blog posts, it's worth
mentioning a few issues from 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 here as well:

* Expose configurable ``DataTable`` row height [`#8411`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/8411)
* Fix issue with legends and empty scatter glyphs [`#8395`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/8395)
* Fix issue with oval, ellipse legends [`#8375`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/8375)
* Recognized CSS rgb(a) strings for colors [`#4096`](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/4096)

For full details, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/CHANGELOG)
and [Release Notes](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/releases.html).
Additionally, examples for each release are uploaded to CDN.
[Click here to download](https://cdn.pydata.org/bokeh/examples/examples-1.0.3.zip).

If you are using
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads), Bokeh can most easily be installed
by executing the command ``conda install -c bokeh bokeh`` . Otherwise, use
``pip install bokeh``.

Apart from the issues linked above, a few broader project news items are worth
mentioning here.

#### New bokeh.org domain

I'm happy to announce that, [with generous help from NumFocus](https://numfocus.org),
the Bokeh project has been able to secure the *bokeh.org* domain. We've already
stood up a few subdomains:

* *badges.bokeh.org* &mdash; Package install stats
* *blog.bokeh.org* &mdash; This site!
* *bokeh-sampledata.bokeh.org* &mdash; New URL for bokeh sampledata
* *demo.bokeh.org* &mdash; Previously *demo.bokehplots.com*

Other sites are planned but not yet active:

* *bokeh.org* &mdash; Polished "front page" for the project as a whole
* *docs.bokeh.org* &mdash; Eventual location for primary docs
* *notebooks.bokeh.org* &mdash; A central place for live Bokeh notebooks
* *share.bokeh.org* &mdash; "Imgur for Bokeh" plot sharing

The last one is worth expanding on. We have a *very* rough prototype of a
simple service to publicly share standalone Bokeh content. Using a new ``bokeh.io.share``
function, fully rendered Bokeh content will be available to link to. The
JSON representation (and possibly a PNG export as well) will also be available
for directly embedding in other pages.

However, you can see how much UX design help we need in the screenshot below:

We can also use assistance with completing the implementation of the Serverless cloud
service itself. This project is an area where a little work from contributors
with the right experience would make an immensely valuable, outsize impact to a *huge* number of Bokeh users.
Please consider [reaching out if you can help](https://gitter.im/bokeh/bokeh-dev)!

#### Upcoming 1.1 release

The next release will be version 1.1. The reason for the minor version bump is
a large update [`#8085` Improve the layout subsystem](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/8085).
This update completely reworks the Bokeh layout system from the ground up. It closes
more than a dozen open layout-related issues, makes large (~100 plot) layouts
much more performant, and adds much more rigorous layout testing across a wide
variety of situations.

We have worked very hard to try and ensure that this necessary work does not
disrupt any existing usage. However, with anything this large
there is always some risk. An easy way for anyone to contribute back to the
Bokeh community is to [test out the upcoming developer builds](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html#developer-builds)
that we will soon make available, and report back any unexpected issues, so the
can be addressed *before* a release!
