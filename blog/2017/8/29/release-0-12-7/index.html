For full details, see the <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/CHANGELOG">CHANGELOG</a>
and <a href="https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.7/docs/releases/0.12.7.html">Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we now package and upload examples for each Bokeh release
to our CDN. <a href="https://cdn.pydata.org/bokeh/examples/examples-0.12.7.zip">Click here to download</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>This release can most easily be installed from the Bokeh channel on
<a href="https://anaconda.org/bryanv/dashboard">Anaconda.org</a> by executing the
command <code>conda install -c bokeh bokeh</code> if you are using
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/downloads">Anaconda</a>, otherwise use <code>pip install bokeh</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Before we get to the fun new features and fixes in this release, a few odds and ends:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to make some dramatic improvements for the long term, a few small, immediate
breaking changes were unavoidable. It is not expected they will affect many users, but
please consult the
<a href="https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.7/docs/releases/0.12.7.html">Release Notes</a>
carefully.</li>
<li>Removal of <code>bokeh.mpl</code> and <code>bokeh.charts</code> is accelerated. With almost no comments
about their deprecation, they will be removed after this release.
Doing so will help lighten the burden on the core team during the busy
lead-up to 1.0.</li>
<li>GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/p-himik">p-himik</a> has been added to <strong><code>@bokeh/dev</code></strong>
after successfully finishing PRs
<a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/6685"><code>#6685</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/6734"><code>#6734</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/6735"><code>#6735</code></a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/6737"><code>#6737</code></a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/6738"><code>#6738</code></a>.
We would love to add you too! Come by the <a href="https://gitter.im/bokeh/bokeh-dev">Dev Chat Channel</a>
to ask about how to get started contributing to Bokeh.</li>
<li>All example and tutorial notebooks in
<a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks"><code>bokeh/bokeh-notebooks</code></a> have
been cleaned and brought up to date with current features. You can
clone the repository to run the notebooks locally, or see statically rendered versions on
<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/blob/master/index.ipynb">nbviewer.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, on to what's new!</p>
<hr>
<h4>Network/Graph Visualizations</h4>
<p>One of the oldest issues in tracker was
<a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/187">#187 &mdash; Support graphs/trees/networks</a>
from way back in 2013. I am happy to report that all the necessary pieces finally
became available, and core dev <a href="https://github.com/canavandl">canavandl</a> put them
together to add this long-awaited feature to Bokeh! This includes flexible and
extensible policies for highlighting and selection, as seen in the examples below (hover
over the graphs to see different interactions):</p>
<div>
<center>
<script
    src="graphs.js"
    id="ffc8a4d5-726a-44db-af00-c21149b09c5c"
    data-bokeh-model-id="a813aa6e-3616-49ed-a52b-70e3c4714f32"
    data-bokeh-doc-id="dd6669cf-03bf-4337-9ecc-bb4fb4b4244c"
></script>
</center></div><p>Check out the new User's Guide section
<a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.7/docs/user_guide/graph.html">Visualizing Network Graphs</a>
for docs and examples. Note that Bokeh itself is suitable for small to
mid-sized graphs, but if you have very large graphs, help is on the way from
<a href="https://datashader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Datashader</a>. Ongoing work will
make the two projects work together seamlessly for interactive exploration of large graphs
across different scales.</p>
<h4>Aspect Ratio Control</h4>
<p>Another very old feature request was
<a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/474">#474 &mdash; Easily control aspect ratio </a>.
The lack of this feature spawned bug reports such as
<a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/517">#517</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/6603">#6603</a>, and many others over the years.
I am happy to say that this issue has been closed by <strong>brand new contributor</strong>
<a href="https://github.com/DuCorey">DuCorey</a>. Now, if you'd like to have auto-ranged
data bounds match the pixel aspect ratio of the axes, it's as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">figure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">match_aspect</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The Pull Request to add this feature came out of the blue, and I was so pleasantly
surprised I had to
leave a <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/6784#issuecomment-323463734">comment expressing my gratitude</a> right there:</p>
<blockquote><p>...<strong>this is the power of OSS</strong>. One reason that this issue has lingered for so long is that I had framed the problem in entirely different terms... But you've come at it from the opposite direction, which <em>never occurred to me at all</em>... I think your approach is actually much simpler as well as more promising!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core team works tirelessly to improve Bokeh. But we don't have a monopoly on
good ideas, and we don't have 100 hours in a day. No matter how hard we might work,
Bokeh will <strong><em>always be better with your contributions</em></strong>. Come by the
<a href="https://gitter.im/bokeh/bokeh-dev">Dev Chat Channel</a> and we will be pleased to help you
get started.</p>
<h4>Improved Categoricals</h4>
<p>Another area where Bokeh has needed improvement for a long time is in its handling
of Categorical data. There was basic support, but it did not cover common cases like
nested categories or hierarchical axes. There was also a clumsy and problematic system
for fine-tuning visual appearance and location of categorical quantities. For this
release, Bokeh's handling of categorical data has been rebuilt from the ground up. All
the plots below, which would have been difficult or impossible before, are now easy to
create:</p>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3"><img src="interval.png" style="max-height:100%; max-width:100%"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="1"><img src="simple_bar.png" style="max-height:100%; max-width:100%"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="1"><img src="stacked_bar.png" style="max-height:100%; max-width:100%"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><img src="grouped_bar.png" style="max-height:100%; max-width:100%"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="1"><img src="mixed_bar.png" style="max-height:100%; max-width:100%"></td>
    <td colspan="1"><img src="split_bar.png" style="max-height:100%; max-width:100%"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><img src="jitter_scatter.png" style="max-height:100%; max-width:100%"></td>
  </tr></table><p><em>(Note: all the images were made with the <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/dev/docs/user_guide/export.html#png-generation"><code>export_png</code></a> function added last release!)</em></p>
<p>Some of the improvements are foundational enhancements, such as the ability to
specify (and display axes for) hierarchical categories. Others come in
the form of new convenience API, such as the <code>jitter</code>, <code>dodge</code> and <code>factor_cmap</code> functions,
or the <code>hbar_stack</code> and <code>vbar_stack</code> glyph methods that make stacking bars trivial:</p>

</pre></div>
<p>Additionally, integrations with Pandas have been improved. For instance, you can now
pass <code>GroupBy</code> objects directly to <code>ColumnDataSource</code> and immediately access any
aggregated fields, such as <code>"mpg_mean"</code> in the snippet below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">bokeh.sampledata.autompg</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">autompg</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">df</span>

<span class="n">group</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">groupby</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;cyl&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vbar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;cyl&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">top</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;mpg_mean&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">width</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mf">0.8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">source</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Check out the new User's Guide chapter
<a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.7/docs/user_guide/categorical.html">Handling Categorical Data</a>
for full details and examples.</p>
<h4>Filterable/Groupable Data</h4>
<p>Another new feature is due to recent contributor <a href="https://github.com/clairetang6">clairetang6</a>,
who added the ability to construct filtered and grouped views on <code>ColumnDataSource</code>. Now in
addition to the usual <code>source</code> argument to glyph methods like <code>circle</code>, you can also pass
a <code>view</code> parameter that will cause only the subset of data for the view to be displayed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Make a view to only show the Versicolor species</span>
<span class="n">vers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">CDSView</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">,</span>
               <span class="n">filters</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">GroupFilter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">column_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;species&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">group</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;versicolor&#39;</span><span class="p">)])</span>

<span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">circle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;petal_length&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;petal_width&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">source</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">view</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">vers</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">color</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;red&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is a great way to share one data source and show different subsets of it with
different gylphs. In addition, I expect this feature will also be an important foundation
for some other planned core library work in the future.</p>
<p>As part of this work, Claire added an entirely new User's Guide chapter
<a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.12.7/docs/user_guide/data.html">Providing Data for Plots and Tables</a>
that not only documents this feature, but also provides a (long overdue) discussion of the
ins and outs of <code>ColumnDataSource</code> in general.</p>
<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<p>There aren't a lot of big-ticket features left to put in to Bokeh before we are
ready to draw a line in the sand. The only "must-do" tasks for considering 1.0 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete BokehJS migration to TypeScript</li>
<li>Integrate Bokeh and JupyterLab</li>
<li>Remove all existing deprecations</li>
<li>Cleanup: bugfixes, docs, automation, polish</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://anaconda.com/">Anaconda, Inc</a> (which is <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/company-blog/continuum-analytics-officially-becomes-anaconda/">formerly Continuum Analytics</a>)
is a primary supporter of both Bokeh and JupyterLab, and has made it a priority that both work
together. We were close to having things working for this release, but there is still
some coordination between projects needed to get things working seamlessly on classic Notebook,
new JupyterLab, and <code>nbconvert</code> all at the same time. We will likely have an extra
release very soon, just to add this support as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Apart from these, there are some "nice-to-have" tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved binary transport for array data</li>
<li>Scriptable animations and transitions</li>
<li>New events for document init, busy/done, etc.</li>
<li>Support "Patches with holes" for GIS usage</li>
<li>Publish BokehJS reference documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be working hard to get in as many of these additional points as possible as we
complete the "must-do" tasks. But once the TypeScript and JupyterLab work is done,
we will begin immediately planning to make the very next release 1.0. Any remaining
"nice-to-haves" can be addressed afterwards &mdash; there is still plenty of work to
finish after 1.0 comes out!</p>
<hr>
<p>As we get closer to a Bokeh 1.0 release, I'd like to thank the <a href="https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/graphs/contributors">247
total contributors</a> who
have helped make Bokeh such an amazing project. As always, for technical questions
or assistance, please post to the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/anaconda.com/forum/#!forum/bokeh">Bokeh Mailing List</a>
